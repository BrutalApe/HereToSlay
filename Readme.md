This will be a Here To Slay analysis tool.
I wanted a way to determine the strengths of different hands and combinations of cards,
so I'm designing this code to help with that.

Taking the old rubik code and repurposing that, instead of starting from scratch.

Properly created repo for HereToSlay, and added buttons for the 
different categories of cards. Lots of organization as well.

fixed optionButton for hero choice selection.
Can reuse the system for item variations if desired
